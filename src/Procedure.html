  <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 45px; text-align: justify;">
    A novel dual motor electric vehicle test rig with mechanical loading designed to carry out the performance analysis of the dual motor propulsion system was designed. 
    The figure shows the overall arrangement of the test rig. It includes two BLDC motors connected in parallel to a common battery pack. 
    The two motors are connected to a common mechanical loading system. 
    The two motors and the common loading shaft were supported on a custom designed mild steel stand. 
    Each motor is connected independently to a throttle. 
    Using this arrangement, the power delivered to the two motors can be manipulated based on our convenience. 
    They also have their own independent controllers. 
    Such a system would allow us to analyze the working a dual motor electric vehicle more easily and also help us understand the key areas for improvement.
